# Lunar Augments

Lunar Shop is replaced with chance-based lunar pods (can have between 0 and 3 pods spawn, 50/50 rolled for every pod)
Lunar Pods permanently remove 10 armor for every pod opened
Shrine of Order clears your current inventory and gives you every lunar item (except Heresy items)
Lunar Items are no longer stackable
